## 2024-06-21 - [html4tree] Unsanitized Filenames in Auto-Generated HTML
**Vulnerability:** XSS via Malicious File/Directory Names
**Learning:** Tools that auto-generate static HTML pages from local file systems often overlook input sanitization, implicitly trusting local file paths. If these generated pages are hosted or shared, an attacker can create files with names like `<script>alert(1)</script>` to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user viewing the generated index.
**Prevention:** Always HTML-encode variable data injected into HTML templates, and URL-encode data used in `href` attributes, regardless of the data's origin (even if it's "just" the local file system). Additionally, ensure HTML attributes like `href` are properly quoted to prevent attribute breakout.

## 2023-10-25 - Path Traversal via Symlinks in Directory Crawlers
**Vulnerability:** The `html4tree` crawler was following symbolic links when generating its static HTML index, creating potential path traversal and arbitrary directory read vulnerabilities if links pointed outside the scope of the tree.
**Learning:** Checking `isDirectory()` is not enough in recursive tree walkers. In Kotlin/Java, a directory pointing to another part of the filesystem via symbolic link will pass `isDirectory()` checks but bypass the intended boundaries.
**Prevention:** Use `java.nio.file.Files.isDirectory(path, LinkOption.NOFOLLOW_LINKS)` for root and child directory checks, and skip symbolic links when rendering generated directory listings unless intentionally supporting external links with validation.

## 2024-06-25 - Prevent Directory Traversal through Symbolic Links
**Vulnerability:** Path traversal and arbitrary write via symlink parsing.
**Learning:** During directory traversal in `html4tree/main.kt`, `File.isDirectory()` returns `true` for symbolic links pointing to directories. A pre-existing `index.html` symlink can also redirect writes outside the intended tree.
**Prevention:** Skip symlinks during recursive directory processing and write generated HTML through a temporary file followed by an NIO move, so an `index.html` symlink is replaced rather than followed.

## 2024-06-26 - [Directory Traversal via Symlink / Un-writable DoS]
**Vulnerability:** The application could crawl symlink directories, accept a symlink as the top-level directory, and walk deeper than the requested max level before deciding not to render.
**Learning:** `File.listFiles()` returns null (not empty) on unreadable directories. Directory crawlers must reject symlink roots, skip symlink children, and avoid enqueueing paths deeper than the configured traversal limit.
**Prevention:** Use `java.nio.file.Files.isSymbolicLink(file.toPath())` for root and child directory checks, gracefully handle `null` arrays from `listFiles()` and `list()`, and only enqueue child directories when the current level is still below `maxLevel`.

## 2024-06-28 - [html4tree] Static HTML Generation Security
**Vulnerability:** Defense in Depth (CSP Missing)
**Learning:** Even when inputs are properly escaped, statically generated HTML that displays file/directory structures should implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to provide an extra layer of defense against potential XSS bypasses.
**Prevention:** Include a strict CSP meta tag (e.g., `default-src 'none'; style-src 'unsafe-inline';`) in auto-generated HTML headers when external scripts or resources are not required.
## 2024-07-02 - Malicious ignore files cause DoS
**Vulnerability:** A malicious actor could place a directory named `.html4ignore` or a massive `.html4ignore` file, leading to application crashes (`java.io.FileNotFoundException: .html4ignore (Is a directory)`) or memory/resource exhaustion.
**Learning:** Applications reading hidden configuration files from user-controlled directories must validate file type (isFile) and size before loading them into memory.
**Prevention:** Add checks for `isFile` and enforce a reasonable file size limit (e.g., 1MB) before parsing directory-level configuration files.
