## 2024-06-25 - Prevent Directory Traversal through Symbolic Links
**Vulnerability:** Path traversal and arbitrary write via symlink parsing.
**Learning:** During directory traversal in `html4tree/main.kt`, `File.isDirectory()` returns `true` for symbolic links pointing to directories. A pre-existing `index.html` symlink can also redirect writes outside the intended tree.
**Prevention:** Skip symlinks during recursive directory processing and write generated HTML through a temporary file followed by an NIO move, so an `index.html` symlink is replaced rather than followed.
