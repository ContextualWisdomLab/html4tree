# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Emit a `noindex, nofollow` robots meta preference on every generated
  directory page, with the explicit boundary that supporting crawlers must
  first fetch the page and that confidential data still requires server-side
  protection.

### Changed

- Improve generated directory-index readability with adjacent-row separators,
  explicit light and dark empty-state text colors, and text-only hover/focus
  underlining while retaining the full interactive target's focus outline.

### Fixed

- 구조적으로 숨겨진 접근성 요소(`.visually-hidden`) 추가 시 기존 호버 및 포커스 밑줄 스타일이 깨지는 문제를 해결하기 위해 CSS 구조적 가상 클래스를 `:last-child`에서 `:nth-child(2)`로 변경했습니다.
- Generate the inline-style Content Security Policy SHA-256 source expression
  from the exact normalized UTF-8 stylesheet bytes emitted into each generated
  `index.html` file, preventing template whitespace from invalidating the policy.

### Tests

- Add a real generated-file regression test that independently recomputes the
  declared style hash from the emitted `<style>` text.
- Add generated-page regressions for row ordering, empty-state semantics, CSS
  cascade ordering, reduced-motion retention, text-only decoration, and numeric
  text/focus contrast thresholds.

### Documentation

- Record the generated-page robots indexing preference, crawler-access
  prerequisite, non-security boundary, rollback contract, and current Google
  Search Central reference in `docs/doctoring/robots-indexing-preference.md`.
- Record the CSP byte-identity decision, threat boundary, verification contract,
  and current W3C Working Draft reference in `docs/doctoring`.
- Record the generated-index readability decision, WCAG 2.2 engineering basis,
  contrast calculations, scope boundaries, and verification contract.
